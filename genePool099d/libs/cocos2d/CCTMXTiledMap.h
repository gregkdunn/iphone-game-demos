/** CCTMXTiledMap knows how to parse and render a TMX map.
 
 It adds support for the TMX tiled map format used by http://www.mapeditor.org
 It supports isometric, hexagonal and orthogonal tiles.
 It also supports object groups, objects, and properties.

 Features:
 - Each tile will be treated as an CCSprite
 - Each tile can be rotated / moved / scaled / tinted / "opacitied"
 - Tiles can be added/removed in runtime
 - The z-order of the tiles can be modified in runtime.
 - Each tile has an anchorPoint of (0,0)
 - The anchorPoint of the TMXTileMap is (0,0)
 - The TMX layers will be added as a child
 - The TMX layers will be aliased by default
 - The tileset image will be loaded using the TextureMgr
 - Each tile will have a unique tag
 - Each tile will have a unique z value. top-left: z=1, bottom-right: z=max z
 - Each object group will be treated as an NSMutableArray
 - Objects can be created using your own classes or a generic object class which will contain all the properties in a dictionary
 - Properties can be assigned to the Map, Layer, Object Group, and Object
 
 Limitations:
 - It only supports one tileset per layer.
 - Embeded images are not supported
 - It only supports the XML format (the JSON format is not supported)
 
 Technical description:
   Each layer is created using an TMXLayer (subclass of CCSpriteSheet). If you have 5 layers, then 5 TMXLayer will be created,
   unless the layer visibility is off. In that case, the layer won't be created at all.
   You can obtain the layers (TMXLayer objects) at runtime by:
  - [map getChildByTag: tag_number];  // 0=1st layer, 1=2nd layer, 2=3rd layer, etc...
  - [map layerNamed: name_of_the_layer];

   Each object group is created using a TMXObjectGroup which is a subclass of NSMutableArray.
   You can obtain the object groups at runtime by:
   - [map objectGroupNamed: name_of_the_object_group];
  
   Each object is a TMXObject.

   Each property is stored as a key-value pair in an NSMutableDictionary.
   You can obtain the properties at runtime by:
   - [map propertyNamed: name_of_the_property];
   - [layer propertyNamed: name_of_the_property];
   - [objectGroup propertyNamed: name_of_the_property];
   - [object propertyNamed: name_of_the_property];
