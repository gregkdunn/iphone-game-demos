 audio file at a time and playing multiple compressed files will result in a performance drop
 as software decompression will take place.

 CDAudioManager manages audio requirements for a game.  It provides access to a CDSoundEngine object
 for playing sound effects.  It provides access to two CDLongAudioSource object (left and right channel)
 for playing long duration audio such as background music and narration tracks.  Additionally it manages
 the audio session to take care of things like audio session interruption and interacting with the audio
 of other apps that are running on the device.
 
 Requirements:
 - Firmware: OS 2.2 or greater 
 - Files: CDAudioManager.*, CocosDenshion.*
 - Frameworks: OpenAL, AudioToolbox, AVFoundation
